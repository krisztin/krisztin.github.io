<p>On the rare occasions when I am not sitting in front of my computer going on yet another Wikipedia binge or trying to build a utopia in Democracy 3 I venture outside either to cycle or to hike around the UK with the husband.</p>

	<h4>Volunteer Developer | <a href="http://coderlist.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coderlist.io</a> | September 2018 -</h4>
	<p>Looking for a project I could contribute to I have messaged coderlist.io who agreed to take me on and tasked me
with: conducting a UX review, redesigning their email templates and a social media strategy overview.</p>
<p>Based on my UX review several changes have been made to the site already (i.e. sign up buttons are now
consistently the primary buttons, the step-by-step guide now has a clearer structure etc.)</p>

<p>I have taken the initiative to first conduct an accessibility audit then start fixing all issues myself. My largest project was trying to find an accessible CAPTCHA solution for the contact forms.</p>

	<h4>Website Officer | <a href="https://themayhew.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayhew Animal Home</a> | 2015 - 2017</h4>
	<p>// Developing and updating content and functionality for the website (WordPress) and webshop (Shopify) based on user needs, analytics data and stakeholder input;<br />
	// Plan, execute and measure digital marketing campaigns across all major platforms;<br />
	// Producing film and photography content;</p>

    <p>Responsible for the development of both the website (Wordpress) and shop (Shopify) I have project managed larger changes and made small adjustments in code myself (e.g. new Shopify cart where you can add a donation value of your choosing to your order).</p>

    <p>During my time here, I have conducted user research with existing and new users, collected feedback from both users and stakeholders within the organisation and lastly, but perhaps most importantly, analysed user behaviour data from Google Analytics and Hotjar. As well as site specific research I have analysed fifty US charities with the most successful online fundraising profiles.</p>

    <p>Based on the above research I have suggested:</p>
    <li>Adding Stripe as a payment provider (with only Standard PayPal we've had a significant drop-out rate as people did not notice the option to pay with card)</li>
    <li>New menu system/page hierarchy (lots of important pages were buried in a maze of clicks)</li>
    <li>Picture/symbol heavy information pages to aid users with little English (an idea picked from our Vet Clinic)</li>
    <li>Filters for cats and dogs (i.e. age, can live indoors etc.)</li>
    <li>Donation boxes: widgets that can be placed on various parts of a page with three fixed value (£5, £20, £50) and a custom field</li>
    <li>How much of £1 goes to our cats and dogs to strengthen donor confidence</li>

<h2>So what makes someone give up working with cats and dogs?</h2>

    <p>When I moved to the UK in 2015 I was given the opportunity to work as a Website Officer for The Mayhew Animal Home. The position was a mix of digital marketing and web development (management).</p>

    {% include img.html file='teapawty.jpg' alt='kitten teapawty'

caption='Filming and photographing cats, the career I gave up' -%}

    <p>Despite of growing up on the likes of Blackadder and being taught the intricacies of British life in school, I had to realise that I still missed a lot of the pop cultural references a marketing professional should be familiar with and hence could never be as effective as a marketer as I used to be.</p>

    <p>Being involved in managing the website, however, I’ve found that there was one language I had no problems with: technology. My job has allowed me to get a taste of web development and I was immediately taken to it as its core values - solving real life problems, designing for users - resonate with me quite strongly.</p>
