My journey into web development started back in the days when we’ve used tables as a grid system, stored files on FTP servers and Internet Explorer was THE browser.
Despite of the long history, development was always just a hobby. Professionally, I’ve spent the last 15ish years in video and digital marketing. All the way through I was the computer and analytics gal, a fan of organic marketing and concerned about customer experience. Looking back it’s a tad obvious I was in the wrong industry.

## I was:

- User Experience Consultant for British charities and small businesses,
- Head of Audience Development at a YouTube Multi-Channel Network managing more than 40 channels from major broadcasters to brands and classic YouTubers,
- Social Media Consultant for both small local businesses and big brands like BMW.

## From kittens to code

When I moved to the UK I was delighted to learn that you could work in the non-profit sector and did so as a Website Officer for The Mayhew Animal Home. The position was a mix of digital marketing and web development.

<p class="skim">I've always thoroughly enjoyed solving real-life problems of real-life people with digital products.</p>

When my job allowed me to get a taste of UX and Web Development I was immediately taken to it realising it might be time to turn my hobby into my profession.

## Behind the scenes
Interested in science and technology, avid cyclist (road, dirt, MTB), hiker and rower... Never seen Star Wars.
