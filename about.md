From videos to social media posts, emails and websites this digital veteran has seen it all and made it organically convert better. The secret? Knowing who the audience is and what they want and anticipating their needs; mainly by looking at lots of analytics dashboards and Excel spreadsheets but also by gathering user feedback.

## In the last 15ish years I was:

- User Experience Consultant for British charities and small businesses,
- Head of Audience Development at a YouTube Multi-Channel Network managing more than 40 channels from major broadcasters to brands and classic YouTubers,
- Social Media Consultant for both small local businesses and big brands like BMW.

When I moved to the UK I was delighted to learn you could work in the non-profit sector and did so as a Digital Officer for The Mayhew Animal Home. The position was a mix of digital marketing and web development.

Despite of having grown up on the likes of Blackadder and being taught the intricacies of British life in school, I had to realise that I still missed a lot of the pop cultural references a marketing professional should be familiar with and hence could never be an effective marketer. Being involved in managing the website, however, I’ve found that there was one thing that was universal: technology.

My job has allowed me to get a taste of UX development and I was immediately taken to it.

## Behind the scenes
On the rare occasions when I am not sitting in front of my computer going on yet another Wikipedia binge, I venture outside either to cycle or to hike with the husband.
