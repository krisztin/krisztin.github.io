    <p>I've given up a more than a decade long career that included photographing kittens and puppies to become a UX Developer. <br> If that's not dedication then I don't know what is.</p>
    <p><em>If you are interested in working with me, have questions or just want me to send you a picture of a cute kitten get in touch.</em></p>
