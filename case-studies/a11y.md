# Spam vs accessibility

## Pain point

Users with assistive technologies are often unable to contact us through the form on the website due to issues with reCAPTCHA. Our forms receive the usual amount of bot attacks hence a form of spam protection is needed.

## How do you fight spam on a contact form in an accessible way?

The answer to the first part of this question is: Google’s reCAPTCHA. Right now it’s probably the most effective way to fight spam on your website, but is it accessible? The short answer is no. The long answer? We should get something out of the way first to answer that.

## What is accessibility?

The common misconception is that accessibility is about making your website work with screen readers and using the proper contrasting colours but this subject is so much more. It is about improving the user experience for everyone be it decreasing load time so that users with slower internet connections can still enjoy browsing your website, or making sure that on smaller screens you have large enough touch/click surfaces for buttons and links so touch device users have an easier time navigating.

## Is reCAPTCHA accessible?

The long answer is still, no. However, it works great when it’s not set off, when you just tick off the checkbox and off you go. Problem is, assistive technology has the tendency to set it off and then that’s it, you have effectively locked out some of your userbase from your website/forum/functionality.

Yes, Google does provide a voice alternative for the pictures but it is close to unintelligible to an actual human being.

## What are the alternatives?

### CAPTCHAs

#### Invisible CAPTCHA

Most accessible of CAPTCHAs when it’s not triggered, however it seems it frequently goes off when using screen readers and assistive technology in which case it reverts back to noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA which is what we were trying to avoid.

#### TextCAPTCHA

One of the - if not the most - accessible form of CAPTCHAs. The flip side is that it is a security risk as a fairly basic script can easily pass it. Furthermore, it relies on cognitive abilities above that of a 7 year-old in English which, if you have ESL users - which Welcome had plenty of - can be an issue, it can add about 10-20 seconds to time spent on solving when someone’s first language is not English.

### Honeypot

Honeypots are fields on a form that trick scripts into filling out a form wrong resulting in it not being sent. It protects from random spam (which was our main issue) but not particularly secure.

## We chose to test a Honeypot

### User testing

Once we have decided on trying out Honeypot it was time to implement it and try it out in the wild. This also meant doing some user testing with one of our colleagues who uses a screenreader. Long story short, it went swimmingly and our user was delighted with the experience.

### Demo

Having taken lead on the project I was asked to present it to the whole Digital team on our by-weekly demo. Thankfully, throughout my career I was often the only techy person in the office which meant I was already adept at explaining complex, technical concepts.

### Pen-test

Being a very basic method of protection the honeypot has easily failed penetration testing as you could get through it easy via HTTP requests.

## UPDATE Oct, 2018

As of now, Google has launched reCAPTCHA v3 which does away with the whole ticking system and simply monitors user activity, scores it then you can block suspicious users. Sounds a bit Orwellian and not necessarily a step towards accessibility.
