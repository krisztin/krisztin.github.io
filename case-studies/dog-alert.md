## Website
<a href="https://themayhew.org/dogs" target="_blank">The Mayhew Animal Home <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>

## User persona
<strong>John, 47, <em>small business owner, lives within 10 miles</em></strong>
<p>Wants to adopt a - preferably - young black labrador as a family dog.</p>
<p>Haven’t adopted from us before therefore his main point of contact is our website.</p>
<p>Does not follow us on social media.</p>

## Pain points:

- Looking for a specific breed of dog can take considerable time having to go through several dog shelter websites due to a lack of real central database.
- More popular breeds/ages tend to get adopted within hours of being added to the listing page.
- Some users might not even return opting on keeping up with only the more high frequency animal homes.
- The Mayhew had - on average - 4 new dogs come up for adoption in a month which is comparatively low and affects the number of returning potential adopters.

## Solution
We’ve added a CTA at the bottom of the dog and cat listing pages to invite potential adopters to sign up to our email alerts. These alerts are sent out every time an animal is published on the site.

## Results
Within its first year we’ve achieved over 1000 subscribers and a consistent growth of 15% month to month.
A rise in returning visitors to the dog listing page.

### Catnotes
Whilst the CTA has been added to the cat listing pages as well due to the nature of cat adoptions (people only usually have preference of colour and age) and the relatively high volume of cats the Mayhew have had the cat alerts were less successful but still was in constant use by hundreds of users every month.
