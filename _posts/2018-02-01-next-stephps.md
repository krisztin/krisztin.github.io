So far my courses have only involved learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and JQuery and JSON). Now, after my Drupal Bootcamp and having admined a Wordpress website for two years, it is time to shift my focus to CMSs and that means it's time for: PHP.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

?>
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 1:**

*Beginner PHP* a 15hr course on Treehouse. Let's code!
