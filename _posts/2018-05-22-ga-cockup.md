I have finally stopped laughing long enough to share this masterful cock-up with the world (or at least the few people who are actually interested in my everyday fumbling about).

[TL:DR and full commit history for devs and those who understand a little code](https://github.com/krisztin/krisztin.github.io/issues/23)

In a nutshell I have somehow managed to break my GA that worked the day before. Queue around 30 minutes of furious debugging where I did discover that the tracking probably did not fire because there was a condition written into my code that would never validate to true as I have removed that bit from my config file because the out of box solution Jekyll provides did not work.
But then removing this bit still did not work. After a lot of fiddling about I have **FINALLY** noticed that the actual code was commented out.
