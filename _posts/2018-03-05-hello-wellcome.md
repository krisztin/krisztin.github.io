After the bootcamp it was time for finding a placement. I had a single minded focus being quite keen on staying in the non-profit sector after two years at an animal shelter. I wanted to be placed at Wellcome. Thankfully, I have managed to do well enough on the interview to be selected as one of the two new Wellcome Software Dev Apprentices.

The journey starts in March!
