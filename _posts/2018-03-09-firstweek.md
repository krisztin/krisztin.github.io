Wow.

I wish I could be more eloquent in describing my first week at Wellcome but there it is: the last five days in three characters.

The people, the knowledge, the work, the history, the building all awe inspiring. As an apprentice I cannot imagine a better environment for learning.
What have I learned so far?

From the first day spent in induction where - amongst many other useful things I have learned how not to electrocute myself - to meeting my team, getting settled and getting to know the systems there was definitely a lot of information to digest. Right now I spend my days in a mix of working with my team and honing my coding skills on Treehouse to slowly but surely become more useful.

Here's to another 17 months and 3 weeks of learning and growing!
