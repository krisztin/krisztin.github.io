Yes, I've made it! I am a student at Harvard...online. And only taking one free class. But still.

I've decided that I should learn some theory after all and figured taking a Computer Science class would be the perfect way to do that. Thankfully, we live in the day and age when you can just hop on the internet and find free courses taught at world renowned universities. No tuition fees, no student loans...and no TAs to help. That's what Google is for!

Here's to 10 more weeks of CS50!
