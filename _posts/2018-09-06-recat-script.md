Now that I've done banging my head against the table and start to find my last hour of suffering hilarious I might as well share with you how much of an idiot/beginner I am.

I wanted a nice and neat folder structure for my css and scss files for my [ReCat React app](https://github.com/krisztin/recat). So I ran `npm start` and then started fiddling with the scripts for `build-css` and `watch-css`...whilst the thing was still running...And I was very frustrated about why no matter how I've changed the structure my .scss file kept being compiled to the same directory.

Lesson learned: restart your app once you make a change in your scripts.
