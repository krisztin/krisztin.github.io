I was looking for a video on something JS related when I’ve stumbled upon [MPJ’s channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q). He is a Front End Dev with around a decade of development under his belt who gave up his job at Spotify to make videos on YouTube. A little bit like me just in reverse.

### Takeaway
Don’t get stuck rule:
Think and try and solve the problem yourself for 15 minutes (this is more like an hour for me right now). Ask for help if you get stuck.

### Conclusion
Needless to say I have subscribed to him immediately.
