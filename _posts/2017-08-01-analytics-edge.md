Being a prolific ‘Google Analytics Investigator’ and lover of everything data I was thrilled to find out that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Analytics Edge course is free and open to attend online. The course covers a lot from linear and logistic regression to k-means clustering and integer optimisation whilst teaching you how to use R, a simple but massively powerful language.

This was definitely much much deeper than I have ever dipped my foot into the field of statistics since my Advanced Economics classes back in secondary school. I have analysed crime data, predicted wine prices and gained insight into airline ticket pricing and even found a tumor on a MRI scan through hierarchical clustering. The entire course was a fascinating glimpse into Big Data and its incredible power to help us learn and evolve.

#### Takeaway
- R skills
- Deeper knowledge of Statistics

#### Conclusion
I will keep Data Science as a hobby but I will probably (definitely) not end up working in Machine Learning or AIs.

#### Until then
The journalist-engineers at [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) are doing some fascinating stuff that's worth a look and are a source of motivation. It's a wonderful mash of thorough research, data science, scrollytelling with JS/Python/R and stunning data visualisation. The below interactive visual is from their [article on Seeing Earth from Outer Space](https://pudding.cool/2017/10/satellites/).
