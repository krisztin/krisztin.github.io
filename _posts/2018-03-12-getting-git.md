Having only done development back in the days when 'version control' was duplicating files and adding version numbers at the end, it was quite the thing to wrap my head around what Git could do (and oh boy, can it do sooo much), how it works and how not to completely mess up my branches.

My manager/mentor/guru has suggested that I transfer all my freeCodeCamp projects to Github as practice.

## Apprentice antics

My first Git cock-up happened when I was on a branch for one project then having finished with it I forgot to change back to master and created a branch for another project off of the finished one.

Lesson learned: check your branch before you go nuts.
