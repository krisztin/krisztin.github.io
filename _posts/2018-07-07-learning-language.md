I’ve always loved learning languages. Growing up my big brother used to study German and I sat by watching him do his homework, asked a bunch of questions and picked up basic German before I knew it. A skill that became very handy when German TV channels in our cable package were seasons ahead in X-Files and Stargate SG1. By the time it was my turn to start learning a language at school English became the primary choice so I have never gotten past "I understand what you're saying, sort of"-level.

Later on I got exposed to Latvian, Russian, Polish, Portuguese and Turkish and lately I have been picking up some Danish (just recently discovered the wonders of Danish television series). Being able to understand so many people is just plain awesome.

## So what does all this have to do with coding?
Essentially programming is like learning another language, only this one you use to speak to a computer.

Now, there is a stage in language learning when you finally start to get it, if someone speaks to you in it or you read an article for instance you can get the gist of it, you may even understand a fairly complex sentence but then it’s your turn to speak and somehow, despite understanding it, you just cannot construct it yourself.

That is the stage I am at right now with JavaScript. If I look at a chunk of code I can get it. But sit me down and ask me to code it from scratch myself and I am stumped.

## Conclusion

Thankfully, I know it’s just a matter of practice.

Believe it or not, I used to get Ds in English for a while before we got internet at home and I’ve spent the whole summer break reading fanfictions. Next year, straight As.

So, what I was meant to say is: thank god for the internet...and fanfiction writers...even if some of you are bonkers.
