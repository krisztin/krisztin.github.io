Since I have decided to become a Developer I have been studying on freeCodeCamp. Itâ€™s an amazing, free online bootcamp with some pretty challenging lessons and challenges.

### Weather API
#### User stories

1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

#### The build
This was a real kicker. My first time working with JSON and my very first GET request to an API. FreeCodeCamp has the tendency to give you a task that they may have not equipped you fully for before to handle. You need to be able to articulate your problems and then do a LOT of research to solve them.
