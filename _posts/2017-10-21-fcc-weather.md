Since I have decided to become a Developer I have been studying on freeCodeCamp. Itâ€™s an amazing, free online bootcamp with some pretty challenging lessons and build challenges.

### Weather API

#### User stories

1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

#### The build

This was a real kicker. My first time working with JSON and my very first GET request to an API. FreeCodeCamp has the tendency to give you a task that they may have not equipped you fully for before to handle. You need to be able to articulate your problems and then do a LOT of research to solve them.

In the end I've managed to throw it together with only a few bugs left:

1. The location error handling was non-existent. I have now managed to fix this with the help of the MDN docs on navigator.geolocation.
2. Fixed footer is not so fixed. My original fixed footer lacked left and righ padding. In fixing this issue the footer is no longer fixed to the bottom. Solution coming soon...hopefully.

As it accesses your location details from the browser the below Codepen snippet will not work. You will have to check the actually working [app on Codepen](https://codepen.io/krisztiiin/pen/oGmqrp/?editors=0010).
