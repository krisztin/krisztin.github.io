excerpt : <p>Why change careers? Why start as an apprentice? When one reaches their 30s and gives up a steady career they enjoy these are all valid questions. In this post I will attempt to answer them.</p>

### Why change careers?

As someone who speaks English as a second language and has grown up in another European country I have always felt a bit inadequate writing copy as I lack the 'common cultural language' and hence missing a lot of the references.
So, I have had a little existential crisis a few months ago. Where can I go from here? What are my options? Naturally, I have asked the wisest of them all: Google. As a creative who lives for solving problems, loves analysing user data and behaviour and was always the 'IT person' in the office it did not take long to find the answer: Software Development.

### Why start as an apprentice?

I could consume all courses online, read all sort of books but nothing will ever compare to learning on the job, having mentors to guide me and learn code that is actually useful in production. Unfortunately, being the prolific Googler that I am I have found myself paralysed by the abundance of courses, guides, ebooks, tutorial videos. Â I have realised that I could make much better progress if I had a someone who could point me in the right direction, saving me hours of research on what to do and instead concentrate on actually doing stuff.

### Happy coincidence

After some more Googling I have found the Web Dev Apprenticeship posting by Happy Ltd. and now here I am,day 2 of a 9 day (spread through 3 weeks) Bootcamp preparing to be an apprentice.

### Pre-Bootcamp

Before the Bootcamp we were provided with a Treehouse account and a prerequisite track. [Check out my Treehouse account](https://teamtreehouse.com/krisztin) to see all the badges I have collected so far. With the track done before the Bootcamp I now have time to tackle something else up there. [My choice: PHP]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-02-01-next-stephps.md %}).
