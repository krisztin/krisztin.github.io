I have started the JavaScript30 course in which you build 30 things with just Vanilla JS. First up: a drum kit.

## Apprentice Antics

#### The difference between ‘ “ and `

My world has significantly expanded when I realised that a third quote symbol exists. This was not working:

What tipped me off in the end was the helpful syntax highlighting of VS Code.

#### Typo

Being able to type without looking at the keyboard is a great skill to have that I can thank my diligent typing teacher from secondary school who not once resorted to holding a book over my hands when she caught me peeking. By now I rarely look down (except on the Mac keyboard) which is great, what’s not so great is that my eyes tend to wander now and rarely are they fixed on the thing I’m actually typing out which means when I do make a typo I tend to not notice it. When I do look at what I’ve written out I just skim.
Obviously, lots of bad habits here to fix.
