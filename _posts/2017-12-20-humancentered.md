User error. Is it an inevitable part of product development or are we - the makers - missing something? Why is it not enough to simply create an amazing product that solves a problem, that functions beautifully but might look a bit ugly? Is design really that important?

There is no hiding it, I am a numbers person. I love staring at user data and figuring out what's behind it. You can twist and skew the results but there is one easy way to be entirely satisfied with your product: good design. Unlike many numbers oriented people, I do like to think of projects in terms of UX and UI and consider the actual human being behind the user data.

####Â What is good design?
Now I have to make it clear, when I say design I don't (just) mean choosing the perfect pictures and colour scheme. It's great if you can put together something visually stunning but at the end of the day what's more important is whether or not your users can actually interact with it without getting distracted, annoyed or simply overwhelmed.

Good design is the one you don't really notice because it adds to and yet does not take away from the actual function. It's also easy to 'discover' on your own even if it's the first time you look at a function, it should be easy to understand how it works.
