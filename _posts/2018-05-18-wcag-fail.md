This is going to be one of those embarassing stories but hey, I promised you entertainment so here it goes.

The two main subjects I am very interested in and would very much like to specialise in are accessibility and security. Having taken at least 3 different courses in the former and having been involved in finding accessible solutions for wellcome.ac.uk it was particularly embarassing to realise that the main colour I have chosen for this blog was in fact failing WCAG colour contrast test, and failing it quite spectacularly at that.

Turns out orange and most of its shades that do not look like what you might find in a baby's diaper are **really** hard to squeeze through the contrast checker with light backgrounds. So, sorry Calum but the orange had to go. It's nothing personal, honest :grimace:

On a related note, I am as good at design as a blind seal with a paintbrush.
