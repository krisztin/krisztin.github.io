This is going to be one of those embarassing stories but hey, I promised you entertainment so here it goes.

The two main subjects I am very interested in and would very much like to specialise in in the future are accessibility and security. Having taken at least 3 different courses in the former and having been involved in finding accessible solutions for wellcome.ac.uk it was particularly embarassing to realise that the main colour I have chosen for this blog was in fact failing WCAG colour contrast test, and failing it quite spectacularly at that.

Briefly, I have considered changing the colour altogether as orange is **really** hard to squeeze through the contrast checker with success but my Product Manager said before that he loved orange and if I change it now there's no way I can convince him it wasn't anything personal :grimacing:
